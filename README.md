# vue-gram

Uses VueJS and Firebase to make a basic social media web app. Built as part of a tutorial, so nothing out of the ordinary in here. My first time using Vue and quite enjoyed it. Have since been distracted by Svelte and SvelteKit. Might revisit it though. I want to migrate my fantasy rugby league app (currently HTML + VanillaJS) into UI components and Vue would be a good option for that.
